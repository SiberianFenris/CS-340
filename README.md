**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

The way that I create programs that contain code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable is by always pushing to keep the code as clean and as simple as possible while also ensuring that plenty of notes are left. Simplicity isn't always the answer so that is why good, clear notes are a godsend. They can help another person go in, take that code, and update it without having to question what exactly I was doing with it.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

The way that I approach a problem is by getting the whole picture and taking well written and clear notes. Notes are one of the most important tools for computer scientists whether it is in our code to help others understand what things do or when jotting down information that a client needs. By taking in all the information and getting that full picture you can know how best to approach the problems at hand in the most logical way.


**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists solve problems by taking an issue, understanding it, and then working toward a solution. The way that my project helps a company like Grazioso Salvare is by seeing the hurdles they are facing and working on a way to make overcoming those easier. They could just sift through a database, but why do that when I can create a dashboard that will give them all that data in a much easier way and give them the data in more ways than one?
